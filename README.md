**CrossBridge** is a Minecraft mod that bridges the gap between Java and Bedrock players, enabling seamless cross-platform interaction on modded Fabric servers. It dynamically translates modded blocks, items, and entities into Bedrock-compatible equivalents, ensuring a unified experience for all players.

## Features
- **Dynamic Translation**: Automatically replaces unsupported modded content for Bedrock players while retaining full functionality.
- **Unified Gameplay**: Java players experience the original modded world, while Bedrock players interact with visually and functionally equivalent translations.
- **Custom Resource and Behavior Packs**: Automatically delivered to Bedrock clients to replicate modded content accurately.
- **Optimized Performance**: Translations occur only for content within Bedrock players' render distances.
- **Event-Driven Efficiency**: Operates only when triggered, minimizing server overhead.

## How It Works
1. **Detect Unsupported Content**:
   - Identifies modded blocks and items that are not natively supported by Bedrock clients.
2. **Dynamic Replacement**:
   - Translates unsupported content into Bedrock-compatible versions on the fly.
3. **Synchronization**:
   - Ensures consistent interactions and updates across Java and Bedrock players.
4. **Resource Packs**:
   - Serves custom packs to Bedrock players upon joining.

## Requirements
- **Minecraft Server**: Fabric-based server.
- **Dependencies**:
  - [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org) 
  - [Floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate)
  - [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer) 

## Installation
1. Download and install the required dependencies (Fabric, Geyser, Floodgate, and Polymer).
2. Place the CrossBridge `.jar` file in your server's `mods` folder.
3. Configure Geyser and Floodgate for Bedrock player compatibility.
4. Start the server to generate CrossBridge configuration files and resource packs.
